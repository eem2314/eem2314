I'm Edward (Ed) Earnest Meyer. Mis amigos latinos me dicen Lalo.
I retired from The Boeing Company 10 years ago, and in retirement
I've written a few papers dealing with flutter, an instability
caused by a structure moving in a fluid. My focus is on practical
methods for predicting flutter in real structures (usually aircraft)
including multiple nonlinearities.

Currently I'm working on adding uncertainties to nonlinear flutter
calculations, hopefuly leading to a publication.

I have written a set of programs I'm calling Flaps which I use for
the calculations in my papers; I'd like to make it available to
any researchers working along these same lines. It is written almost
entirely in C++.

A list of my publications is available at
